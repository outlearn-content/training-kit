# Using Issues

Use GitHub issues to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier in a variety of ways, by:

* Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team has the complete story.
* Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests.
* Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
* Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation.

Do | Say
---|---
Navigate to the `class repository` | Let's dive a little deeper into Issues.
"Navigate to the issue `Class Goals`" | Here, I will create an issue titled Class Goals. Let's look at some of the special features in issues that you will use to collaborate with your team.
Add an issue comment demonstrating markdown formatting for headers, bullets and checkboxes. | GitHub uses a syntax called Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to issues.
"@mention any co-teachers" | One of our favorite features is the @mention. When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.
Click `Preview` | You can use the preview tab to see how your comment will be rendered (meaning how GitHub will actually display your Markdown file).
Include an issue attachment | You can also add pictures by simply dragging and dropping them into the comment field, or clicking the file uploader link.
Click `Comment` | Click the green comment button to add your comments to the discussion.
Return to the `Issues` view | As you can imagine, a large project can have hundreds of issues. Let's look at a few ways your project team can organize issues.
"`Assign` the issue to the co-teacher" | First, you can assign issues to anyone with access to the repo. Typically, this will be the person who is currently responsible for the next step in the life of the issue. The issue assignee may change over time.
Add a `label` to the issue | You can also use labels to help you organize issues. GitHub comes with a number of built-in labels, but you can always delete those or add your own. As a project grows in size, using assignees and labels makes it much easier to find a specific issue.
"Click `Issues > Filters`" | Filters allow you to easily search for Issues by creator, labels, assignees and more. We will continue to explore these features throughout the course. For now, let's practice creating an issue!

Let's practice creating issues now!

<!-- @task, "text" : "Create an Issue to add your bio to the repo. The issue should contain each of the following: your name, a request to add your bio, some markdown formatting, and an @mention for the instructor." -->

<!-- @task, "text" : "Assign the issue you just created to yourself." -->

<!-- @task, "text" : "Apply the label of \"Bio\" to the issue." -->
