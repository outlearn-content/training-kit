# Editing Pull Request Files

<br>

Since you created the pull request, you will be notified when someone adds a comment. In this case, the comment tells us we need to make a change to the file we have already created. Let's see how GitHub makes this easy.

Do | Say
---|---
"Navigate to your `pull request`" | "Let's go back to your pull request and make the edits requested by your collaborators."
"Open the `files changed` view" | "Take a look at the change requested and then go to the files changed view."
"Click the `edit` icon" | "Click the pencil icon to access the file editor."
"Edit the file" | "Make the requested changes."
"Add a `commit message`" | "The commit message should describe what was changed in the present tense. For example, Add favorite color."
"Choose the option to `Commit directly to your branch`" | "Since we accessed our file through the pull request, GitHub helpfully directs us to commit our changes to the same branch."
"Click `Commit changes`" | "And then click commit changes."
"Click the `Commits` tab" | "If you want to see what was changed in a specific commit, you can go to the Commits tab and click on the Commit ID. Go ahead and check your own pull request now to see if you need to make any changes."
