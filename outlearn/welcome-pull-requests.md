# Continue Learning GitHub

This path continues to teach you how to get most out of GitHub by introducing you to pull requests. If you haven't already, we recommend you first go through the path [Getting Started with Collaboration](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/github-training/collaboration).

We've open sourced all of our class outlines, slides, and cheat sheets so you can easily leverage these high-quality educational materials.

Let's continue to learn!
