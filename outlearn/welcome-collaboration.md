# Education from the experts

We love helping people just like you use GitHub and Git to collaborate and be more productive. No matter your level of experience, weâ€™ve got something just for you.

We've open sourced all of our class outlines, slides, and cheat sheets so you can easily leverage these high-quality educational materials.

This learning path introduces you to GitHub and the collaboration features we will use throughout all the GitHub paths.

Great to have you with us!
